# HearthDuster
Need some dust? Don't know what to disenchant? HearthDuster shows you what cards you can safely disenchant to keep your collection at a playable level.

## Download
The current version is 0.8. See the release notes for latest changes.

- MacOS
- Windows

## How does it work?
HearthDuster reads your card collection when you play and recommends card that you can disenchant based on one of the following strategies:

- **Duplicates**: cards you have way too many, like 2 from the same legendary or more than 2 from a normal card. Golden and normal ones are calculated separately.
- **Joint duplicates**: cards you have way too many including golden ones. For example two normal and one golden copy of the same card means you only need to keep one normal.
- **Wild**: cards that are no longer in standard.
